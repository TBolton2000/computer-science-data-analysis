# computer-science-data-analysis-datathon2019
A group project that my team worked on during TAMU Datathon 2019

Datathon 2019 is a Data Science Hackathon hosted at Texas A&M University.

Our team developed a program that helps you visualize the frequency of the words in a given text file.
Along side that we collected data on computer science practice problems to analyze and discover trends in the reoccuring words 
in such problems to give students insight on what things to expect in a software engineering internship technical interview.
